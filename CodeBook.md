The “activity” variable

The “activity” variable is a factor that can assume the following values:

WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

The “subject” variable

The subject variable is an integer between 1 and 30, corresponding to the 30 volunteers that performed the six activities listed above.

The mean variables

The mean variables are numeric, calculated for each activity and each subject, and named as follows:

"tBodyAcc.Mean.X"               
"tBodyAcc.Mean.Y"
